        <h2>Introduction</h2>
        Spring is a collection of small, well-focused, loosely coupled Java
        frameworks that can be used independently or collectively to build
        industrial strength applications of many different types. The PetClinic
        sample application is designed to show how the Spring
        application frameworks can be used to build simple, but powerful
        database-oriented applications. It will demonstrate the use
        of Spring's core functionality:<br>
        <ul>
            <li>JavaBeans based application configuration using
                Inversion-Of-Control<br>
            </li>
            <li>Model-View-Controller web Presentation Layer</li>
            <li>Practical database access through JDBC, Hibernate, or Apache OJB</li>
            <li>Declarative Transaction Management using AOP<br>
            </li>
            <li>Data Validation that supports but is not dependent on the
            Presentation Layer</li>
        </ul>
        The Spring frameworks provide a great deal of useful infrastructure to
        simplify the tasks faced by application developers. This infrastructure
        helps developers to create applications that are :<br>
        <ul>
            <li><span style="font-weight: bold; text-decoration: underline;">concise</span>
                by handling a lot of the complex control flow that is needed to use the
            Java API's, such as JDBC, JNDI, JTA, RMI, and EJB.</li>
            <li><span style="font-weight: bold; text-decoration: underline;">flexible</span>
                by simplifying the process of external application configuration
                through
                the use of Reflection and JavaBeans. This allows the developer to
                achieve a clean separation of configuration data from application code.
                All application and web application objects, including validators,
                workflow controllers, and views, are JavaBeans that can be configured
            externally.</li>
            <li><span style="font-weight: bold; text-decoration: underline;">testable</span>
                by supplying an interface based design to maximize pluggability. This
                facilitates unit testing of Business Logic without requiring the
                presence
            of application or live database servers.</li>
            <li><span style="font-weight: bold; text-decoration: underline;">maintainable</span>
                by facilitating a clean separation of the application layers. It most
                importantly helps maintain the independence of the Business Layer
                from the Presentation layer. PetClinic demonstrates the use of a
                Model-View-Controller
                based web presentation framework that can work seamlessly with many
                different types of view technologies. The Spring web application
                framework helps developers to implement their Presentation as a clean
                and thin layer focused on its main missions of translating user actions
            into application events and rendering model data.</li>

        It is assumed that users of this tutorial will have a basic knowledge
        of object-oriented design, Java, Servlets, JSP, and relational
        databases. It also assumes a basic knowledge of the use of a J2EE web
        application container.<br>
        <br>
        Since the purpose of the sample application is tutorial in nature, the
        implementation presented here will of course provide only a small
        subset
        of the functionality that would be needed by a real world version of a
        PetClinic application.<br>
        <br>
        <h2>PetClinic Sample Application Requirements</h2>
        The application requirement is for an information system that is
        accessible through a web browser. The users of the application are
        employees of the clinic who in the course of their work need to view
        and
        manage information regarding the veterinarians, the clients, and their
        pets. The sample application supports the following:<br>
        <br>
        <span style="font-weight: bold;">Use Cases:</span><br>
        <ul>
            <li>View a list of veterinarians and their specialties</li>
            <li>View information pertaining to a pet owner</li>
            <li>Update the information pertaining to a pet owner</li>
            <li>Add a new pet owner to the system</li>
            <li>View information pertaining to a pet</li>
            <li>Update the information pertaining to a pet</li>
            <li>Add a new pet to the system</li>
            <li>View information pertaining to a pet's visitation history</li>
            <li>Add information pertaining to a visit to the pet's visitation
            history</li>
        </ul>
        <span style="font-weight: bold;">Business Rules:</span><br>
        <ol>
            <li>An owner may not have multiple pets with the same
            case-insensitive name.</li>
        </ol>
        <br>
        <ul>
        </ul>
