/**
 * <b>This is the central class in the lucene search core package.</b>
 * It simplifies the use of lucene to search documents using searcher.
 * It helps to avoid common errors and to manage these resource in a
 * flexible manner.
 * It executes core Lucene workflow, leaving application code to focus on
 * the way to create Lucene queries and extract datas from results.
 *
 * <p>This class is based on the SearcherFactory abstraction which is a
 * factory to create Searcher for a or several configured Directories.
 * They can be local or remote. So the template doesn't need to always
 * hold resources and you can apply different strategies for managing
 * index resources.
 *
 * <p>Can be used within a service implementation via direct instantiation
 * with a SearcherFactory reference, or get prepared in an application context
 * and given to services as bean reference. Note: The SearcherFactory should
 * always be configured as a bean in the application context, in the first case
 * given to the service directly, in the second case to the prepared template.
