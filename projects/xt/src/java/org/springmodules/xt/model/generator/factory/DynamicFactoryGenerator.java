/**
 * <p>
 * Dynamically generate factory objects.<br>
 * For dynamically generating a factory object you simply have to provide 
 * an interface with a number of setter methods, representing constructor arguments
 * and properties to use for constructing the <i>product object</i>, and a factory method
 * returning the class (or superclass) of that product object.
 * </p>
 * <p>
 * More specifically, the factory interface supports the following methods, that must obey the following rules:
 * <ul>
 *      <li><b>Setter</b> methods must be annotated either with the {@link org.springmodules.xt.model.generator.annotation.ConstructorArg}
 *          annotation if they are constructor arguments, or with the {@link org.springmodules.xt.model.generator.annotation.Property}
 *          annotation if they are properties to be set.</li>
 *      <li>The <b>factory</b> method must be annotated with the {@link org.springmodules.xt.model.generator.annotation.FactoryMethod}
 *          annotation.</li>
 *      <li>Moreover, there can be <b>getter</b> methods corresponding to the setter methods above.</li>
 * </ul>
 * Any other method, if called, will throw an exception.
 * </p>
 * <p>
 * Once generated, the factory can be used by calling the setter methods, for initializing object constructor arguments and properties,
 * and finally the factory method.
 * </p>
 * <p>
 * Please <b>note</b> that this generator generates a new factory object for every call to its {@link #generate()} method, and the factory
 * generates a new product object for every call to its factory method.
 * </p>
 * <p>
 * <b>Restrictions</b>: The only restriction is that the getter methods of your factory cannot return primitive values; so, you
 * have to use wrapper objects instead when you need to return a primitive type.
 * </p>
 * <p>This class is <b>thread-safe</b>.</p>
 *
 * @param F The type of the dynamically generated factory object.
 * @param P The type of the product object created by the factory.
