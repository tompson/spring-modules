/**
 * Callback interface for creating a Lucene document instance from an
 * InputStream.
 *
 * <p>Used for input Document creation in LuceneIndexTemplate. Alternatively,
 * Document instances can be passed into LuceneIndexTemplate's corresponding
 * <code>addDocument</code> methods directly but the application must manage
 * the opening/closing of the InputStream.
 *
 * <p><b>Caution</b>: You cannot use the DocumentCreator if you want to index datas
 * from an InputStream. If you use an InputStream with a DocumentCreator, you
 * need to manage the stream outside the template and don't close it in the
 * createDocument method because the stream must be still opened when the
 * addDocument is called.
